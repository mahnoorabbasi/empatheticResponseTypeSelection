# Generation of Artificial Empathetic Emotional Responses in Natural Language
Conversational and dialogue agents have gained importance recently in various sec-
tors of human life. However, due to the lack of comprehending empathy from tex-
tual data, the textual response of these agents still lacks in selecting the empathetic

response type for text-based communications. This paper solves this problem by
utilizing Nonviolent Communication Methodology for creating a framework that
models empathetic communication type selection in textual domain. Our model
utilizes Rosenberg’s axiom that works in a seeker-listener scenario. For each of
the seeker utterance, it finds the presence of blame and emotional intensity and
predicts the type of empathic textual response that is given by the listener from

two available communication types i.e., explorative, and parallel empathetic com-
munication. We used Rosenberg’s guidelines to detect the blame in the sentence

and VAD (Valence, Arousal, Dominance) to find the emotional intensity of the

sentence. Using the above two parameters, our framework selects explorative em-
pathetic response for a sentence that has positive value of blame and emotional

intensity higher than a threshold.
